It's a 'last resort' choice for me (out with friends, have to order something, don't have any other choice - or maybe I'm just really really lazy and I haven't eaten takeout in 2 months - don't make it a habit kind of thing).

The killer is the large portion of guacamole on top (most places give you what ever comes off the spoon, up to 1/2 a cup), and the large amount of salt in it. One bowl with regular rice and beans, veggies, salsas, and guac will bring you up to or over the recommend daily limit for sodium. The tortillas are delicious, but also very calorically dense (to me at least, as I don't find them filling) at 300/per tort, and very high in sodium. I'd look at getting a regular portion of rice and beans, and brining your own lettuce to supplement and create a salad to fill you up.\n",

I usually get the veggie burrito with medium+hot salsa and it’s close to 2000mg of sodium. Far too much sodium to be eating it every day. You’re better off stocking up on unsalted canned beans and unsalted corn tortillas and just making super simple tacos at home. Like literally just take tortillas out of the bag and scoop on canned beans and if you can, add some veggies. It’s also way cheaper.

But pretty much everything else, like guacamole and the corn/tomato salsa, were made fresh every morning. We literally got in the store at 6/7 AM just to prep for the day. We'd chop/dice countless amounts of red onions, jalapenos, cilantro bunches, etc just to make these things, which is truly impressive to think about considering just how much we needed to make to sustain the entire day.

They have been used for more than 5,000 years by the Native Americans, who not only used the seeds as a food and an oil source, but also used the flowers, roots and stems for varied purposes including as a dye pigment. The Spanish explorers brought sunflowers back to Europe, and after being first grown in Spain, they were subsequently introduced to other neighboring countries. Currently, sunflower oil is one of the most popular oils in the world. Today, the leading commercial producers of sunflower seeds include the Russian Federation, Peru, Argentina, Spain, France and China.\n",

       "'Comment 1: Hey folks, former chipotle employee here.  The ingredients are very well sourced, often times using local farmers for tomatoes, corns, lettuce, etc.  \\nAll cooking is done with limited ingredients and (it’s been a while so I’m not 100% sure on this one) no preservatives.  \\nWhen you get the corn salsa, it is literally 6 ingredients- corn, jalapeños, red onion, cilantro, lime juice and salt. \\n\\nNow, it must be said that a lot of items are high calories.  The big tortillas are 300+ calories, the chicken isn’t breast meat, it’s thighs. \\n\\nA lot of items are high salt, because Steve Ells, the founder, really liked salt.Comment 2: Better than the alternative places to eat outComment 3: Everything there is loaded with sodium. Even what looks like it should be healthy.Comment 4: When I’m out and about I always look for Mediterranean restaurants. Some have lentil salads or falafel bowls. Yes they use oil but they at least have pretty healthy vegan options.Comment 5: Are you me bc I work in tech and have been eating Chipotle the past two weeks for lunch and wondering the same thing.  I think it boils down to oils used in the cooking process and maybe in the rice to keep it from sticking.  How much oil we\\'re having at each meal is unknown and how much is healthy... beats me.  Think they\\'d add sugar to the veggies? Lol.Comment 6: Nothing in that ingredients list sounds problematic to me.  Unless you\\'re worries about calories.  Avocado is very high in fats and calories.  Beans and rice are also high in calories, but generally very healthy (especially brown rice).\\n\\nSo if you\\'re trying to watch your weight then maybe cut down on the guac.... but if that\\'s not an issue for you then you\\'re probably fine.Comment 7: [deleted]Comment 8: Probably better than some other options, just keep in mind that regardless of the establishment, literally every food choice at every restaurant is loaded with oil and sodium, with the exception of, perhaps, steamed rice at a Japanese restaurant. Having worked in restaurants myself for many years, I personally deem ALL restaurant food as unhealthy. It\\'s a \\'last resort\\' choice for me (out with friends, have to order something, don\\'t have any other choice - or maybe I\\'m just really really lazy and I haven\\'t eaten takeout in 2 months - don\\'t make it a habit kind of thing). But, can you eat a plant-based meal there? Sure.Comment 9: I\\'ve eaten Chipotle in a pinch. I get the \"make your own\" bowl with a tortilla on the side. I get a little rice with lots of beans. Then I get some veggies, corn and lettuce. No guac. A little hot sauce on the side. Then I roll a burrito and eat the rest of the bowl. I don\\'t do it too often because of the oil but it\\'s ok if you\\'re hard up.Comment 10: I usually eat over 2 meals…. Cut in half and keep second half for lunchComment 11: It’s not the ideal option, but it’s better than most if you don’t have anything prepped.Comment 12: It’s it healthy? No. Is it better than McDonald’s? Yes \\n\\nHere you can enter what you get and look at  the  nutrition info. https://www.chipotle.com/nutrition-calculator\\n\\nI get being busy as I work 12 hours a day. And I work 6 days a week. And since I can’t afford to eat out I do cook. I will cook a batch of something as in meal prep and then eat the same thing several days in a row. Then I cook something else and do the same.\\n\\nAnd are you looking last macros and into micros? As in sodium levels are probably high? Or how many calories you are eating? But is still better calories than say a McDonald’s hamburger.Comment 13: If you are seeking optimal health, there are nearly zero restaurants to patronize. Salt, fat, and sweet are the tools of showing a profit. But there are degrees to healthy. Eating it daily could definitely create measurable health consequences. Once a month would allow more time to recover. I tried a 90 10 appproach, 90% healthy, 10% splurge. Had high cholesterol and finally had a recent heart attack. 15 years ago I was 90 lbs heavier and was not plant based. Lost the weight and thought that other than the cholesterol,  I was healthy. Turned out I wasn\\'t The number 1 comment post heart attack was \"but you eat healthier than anyone I know\" Restaurant visits are now very very rare. And Im ok with that. Glad to be alive.Comment 14: Nutrition info is surely online!Comment 15: Like everyone said- salt is the main culprit. If you’re not putting on extra weight i don’t think the oil is that serious. They make microwaveable rice packets, and guacamole single packs. If you got some interesting salsa and relied on just that and the guac for salt- you could build your own pretty easy without too much effort. Plus you could rotate in spinach,  arugula, and baby kale into your bowls which would be an amazing addition for your health.Comment 16: Brown rice, beans and greens burrito, no cheese or cream, is hella healthy.Comment 17: No.  Loaded with oils.  Vegetable oils are still loaded with calories and fat.Comment 18: Play around with their nutrition calculator until you find something that looks good for you :)Comment 19: The wrap has all the calories… just an FYIComment 20: In my opinion, it\\'s only useful to think about how healthy a food is as it compares to what your other options are.  If you are going to be eating out or eating fast food and are comparing it to the other fast food options, it\\'s likely going to be your one of the healthiest option, especially if you are not getting the meat.  And it can be made an even healthier choice by skipping the meat, cheese, and sour cream.  \\n\\nThat said, it is less heathy that would you could be making at home, where you could use better quality ingredients, better oil, ext.  But if that\\'s not an option anyway, then Chipotle is a good way to go.Comment 21: Uhhhh ya no.Comment 22: I am no sugar, no salt no oil, so it’s a big no for me. I’m pretty extreme. \\n\\nBut, for some people Chipotle may be the healthiest thing they eat all week.Comment 23: Yes, definitely can be. \\nVeggie salad:\\n- Salad mix base\\n- brown rice\\n- fajita mix\\n- black and/or pinto beans\\n- pico\\n- corn\\n- guac\\n- cheese if you want\\n- more lettuce on top\\n\\n💯Comment 24: I mean obviously chicken lettuce salsa corn and some black beans sounds healthy but it’s like a shit ton of sodium that I know for sure and (I’m assuming here )other greases fats oils spices etc. so you may as well go to the local chang hai and order gener Tsos chicken and four carts of beef fried rice (ew who orders beef fried rice right) but with a DIET coke only bc we’re watching our weight !Comment 25: People keep saying it’s better than McDonalds but that is such a low bar to compare to.Comment 26: Will you have time for your dialysis appointment when your kidneys fail from all the sodium? Haha I’m being extreme but seriously if you have to ask … what do you think ..Comment 27: Hell yeah, i think it’s healthy. I’d eat it every day if I could- sofrita bowl with pico and guacamole. Daaaaang. I personally don’t worry about salt and oil. If those 2 are your major concerns then i suppose your could just make your other meals without salt and oil (meh)\\n\\nThis thread feels very uptightComment 28: NopeComment 29: I love Chipotle, but if I eat it two days in a row, my posterior is making repentance to the porcelain gods for at least a couple of days. I don\\'t know why, because I get the chicken protein bowls sans beans. But c\\'est la vie. Maybe it\\'s just me. Nevertheless, I still love Chipotle. Perhaps Cartman was right lol...Comment 30: Depending on how much sauce you put on it, I wouldn’t say it’s unhealthy, but you should eat other things. LolComment 31: If you want to go crazy, cut brown rice down to a half scoop and sub lettuce.\\n\\nI used to eat chipotle heavily when I was traveling and usually felt great.Comment 32: I used to work at chipotle. They use sunflower oil to fry the chips, and regular canola/veggie oil in the rice and beans. The killer is the large portion of guacamole on top (most places give you what ever comes off the spoon, up to 1/2 a cup), and the large amount of salt in it. One bowl with regular rice and beans, veggies, salsas, and guac will bring you up to or over the recommend daily limit for sodium. The tortillas are delicious, but also very calorically dense (to me at least, as I don\\'t find them filling) at 300/per tort, and very high in sodium. I\\'d look at getting a regular portion of rice and beans, and brining your own lettuce to supplement and create a salad to fill you up.Comment 33: It can be healthyComment 34: i am not sure if i would classify it as healthy, per se. but it’s definitely fresher and a heck of a lot better than other quick-casual choices. their ingredients are fresh and prepped throughout the day.Comment 35: Warning: Chipotle salad dressing has honey in itComment 36: I’ve been hearing a lot recently about vegetable oil not being healthy (not chipotle specific ofc)Comment 37: No.Comment 38: Chipotle once had, and might still, a nutrition calculator for their menu items. Play with it and order accordingly. \\n \\nFor me, that means no rice at all. I get the black beans even though I shouldn’t. \\n \\n*Avocado is one of the best fats but calculate whether you need guacamole or just to remove cheese.  Do you really need extra beans?  Do you need rice at all? Do you just need 1/2 rice and 1/2 beans  portions instead?*Comment 39: I get a veggie bowl or burrito like yours sans guac. I get black beans instead of pinto. I have no guilty feelings at all. Same when I do Zaba\\'s.Comment 40: They have a nutrition calculator on their website. Plug in your order on there and see for yourself. I usually get the veggie burrito with medium+hot salsa and it’s close to 2000mg of sodium. Far too much sodium to be eating it every day. You’re better off stocking up on unsalted canned beans and unsalted corn tortillas and just making super simple tacos at home. Like literally just take tortillas out of the bag and scoop on canned beans and if you can, add some veggies. It’s also way cheaper. But if I had to eat out at a restaurant, chipotle is pretty high up there for a healthy option mainly because most other places are worseComment 41: Too many carbs at night with the rice and beans.Comment 42: Seitan burritos are phenomenal at Chipotle.Comment 43: Thanks for that info !Comment 44: I’m mostly curious about the amount of salts and the amount and type of oils. Any insight there?Comment 45: Also former employee here-\\n\\nThere were only a few things when I worked there a couple years ago that were **NOT** made in-house: The beans, the sofritas, the pulled pork, the barbacoa beef, the red/green salsas, and obviously things like sour cream and queso cheese. But pretty much everything else, like guacamole and the corn/tomato salsa, were made fresh every morning. We literally got in the store at 6/7 AM just to prep for the day. We\\'d chop/dice countless amounts of red onions, jalapenos, cilantro bunches, etc just to make these things, which is truly impressive to think about considering just how much we needed to make to sustain the entire day. Guac was the worst, since we has to peel, de-pit, and smash the avocados, which sometimes were hard as rocks.   \\n\\n\\nSo to answer OP\\'s question, it\\'s mostly healthy in that it\\'s mostly real food that has a small number of whole, real ingredients. But it can be high in sodium and oils depending on what you get. The items on their menu that I consider to be the least \"healthy\" are the tortillas, chips (this is the hardest one for me), cheese/queso, sour cream, white rice, the sofritas, and most of the meats.Comment 46: This all makes sense why I love it so much! But definitely overindulge on the chipsComment 47: essentially came to the comments to say this. as a former chipotle KM salt is really the only big health “issue”. everything is doused in salt. you can get plain rice w/o salt but it will still have oilComment 48: He might have liked salt but the real reason is because salt makes customers thirsty, what happens when our customers get thirsty?? Drinks. If they didn’t get a drink when purchasing the food, they definitely will mid or after eating and the more drinks the more money comes in. That’s the fast food industry, all restaurants have an excessive amount of salt not only for flavor but for the reason I just said.Comment 49: I’ll add to this, the rice has a ton of oil and salt mixed in with it. So maybe go for a salad.Comment 50: Plant based sub so I don\\'t think the meats an issue but chicken thigh > brestComment 51: Obligatory video of mcDougall explaining that salt isn’t a problem\\n\\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zfQPhNhQC5oComment 52: Why did you guys cave to the vegetarians and change your pinto bean recipe it use to be cooked using pig fat I think?Comment 53: What did you do at Chipotle?Comment 54: I\\'m also a former Chipotle employee. I loved my time there :)Comment 55: That’s for sure !Comment 56: As long as you drink plenty of water, sodium isn\\'t bad. Sodium doesn\\'t make a meal unhealthy.Comment 57: Sodium is not automatically unhealthy. Sodium is a concern for people worried about raising their blood pressure. Many healthy people or people with low blood pressure don\\'t need to (or shouldn\\'t) restrict their sodium intakeComment 58: Obligatory video of mcDougall explaining that salt isn’t a problem\\n\\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zfQPhNhQC5oComment 59: 😂😂 and it’s the unknown part about it that kills me and their rice never sticks so you know they use a crap ton of oil I think I just might starting making my own veggie bowls for a better peace of mindComment 60: As a former Chipotle employee, I promise they didn\\'t add sugar to the veggies as of 2018. LolComment 61: >Think they\\'d add sugar to the veggies? Lol.\\n\\nSadly that would not be surprising at all!Comment 62: Yeah weight is not an issue I just generally want to make sure I am eating healthy!Comment 63: Massive amounts.Comment 64: You are absolutely right I didn’t even think about thatComment 65: You call not eating takeout lazy?!

But I am going to start making my own power bowls no more chipotle! And as far as sodium goes I am not crazy worried about it because I eat one cooked meal  a day I usually wake up and have one big bowl of over night oats loaded with fruits and seeds or a big veggie smoothie and that holds me over until dinnerComment 74: It’s not uptight to be aware of the fact that eating food loaded with salt literally every single day isn’t a healthy choice.Comment 75: Thanks for the feedbackComment 76: 😂😂😂😂Comment 77: Never thought of that but it sounds like a great idea thanks !Comment 78: While sunflowers are thought to have originated in Mexico and Peru, they are one of the first plants to ever be cultivated in the United States. They have been used for more than 5,000 years by the Native Americans, who not only used the seeds as a food and an oil source, but also used the flowers, roots and stems for varied purposes including as a dye pigment. The Spanish explorers brought sunflowers back to Europe, and after being first grown in Spain, they were subsequently introduced to other neighboring countries. Currently, sunflower oil is one of the most popular oils in the world. Today, the leading commercial producers of sunflower seeds include the Russian Federation, Peru, Argentina, Spain, France and China.Comment 79: This isn’t the vegan subredditComment 80: Thanks for the info!Comment 81: ?Comment 82: [deleted]Comment 83: Great question. And since it’s been a bunch of years since I’ve worked for them, my answer might not be accurate. \\n\\nBut, oil is always vegetable oil. And it’s not used in many recipes. \\n\\nThe salad dressing was made in house, and it’s base is vegetable oil.  As for specific amounts, I can’t remember.  The fajita veggies are sautéed in a tablespoon or so of oil.  Oooh, the rice!! I forgot about rice. There’s quite a bit of oil in the rice.  Probably a half cup-full cup in a huge rice cooker. \\n\\nSalt is used in lots of the side items. The chicken and steak are marinated in a pre made adobo sauce that is delivered to the restaurant. Hard to say how much sat is in there.  There’s so much extra flavor, my guess is not much added salt. \\n\\nCorn salsa are guac are made on site.  A huge bowl, like 18” diameter bowl of guac had a couple tablespoons of salt.  And it’s coarse kosher salt if that means anythingComment 84: Good questionComment 85: When I’ve seen him talk about it, he mentions home cooked meals with a pinch of salt are no problem. I think most people would agree that’s fine. 1 burrito from chipotle is already more than a whole day’s worth of sodium (>2000mg) according to the nutrition calculator on their website. That’s way different than what you end up with when you’re cooking at homeComment 86: I started as a line employee, then after a few months I was on the team that opened a new store 30 or so miles away in a new town.Comment 87: This is bullshit and people need to stop spreading it. It\\'s literally the number #1 diet killer in the states. Water doesn\\'t just \"negate\" the negative effects of excessive sodium intake.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/YNHsCBzm_Fs?t=58Comment 88: I think when you strive too hard for \"perfection\" it\\'s a quick way to burn yourself out & not maintain a habit. Doing the right thing becomes too difficult. \\n\\nThis isn\\'t a forever phase of your life. If eating Chipotle helps you stay on track while taking a task off your busy plate, then do it!Comment 89: It is entirely possible to make unsticky rice with very little to no oil, particularly if you parboil it. I suggest you write to their customer service to ask, they are very interested in being as transparent as is practical for a big chain.Comment 90: I believe that rinsing your rice really well makes it less sticky.Comment 91: Pretty much all of big Ag do sweeten their crap, but it’s not a few grams of sugar here and there that’ll do anything bad compared to lathering everything in oil and using fatty animal cutsComment 92: \\\\*Eating takeout is me being lazy.Comment 93: I get chipotle way too much too. I think glitter say it pretty well being healthier than McDonalds, but still not fantastic. The three things I think are unhealthy is a) it\\'s a ton of salt b) oils? c) they usually give a heap of guacamole which is maybe not the best? D) pet peeve of mine is often I get rice that\\'s either uncooked or been sitting so long it dries out and I\\'m afraid I\\'ll break a tooth at some pointComment 94: It really is up to the macros you seek. Based on your description I’d do 1/2 beans & 1/2 brown rice with no cheese or guac. Why? I want to keep my fat lower. Beans are an incomplete protein without rice.    \\n \\nAlso, what is your definition of healthy? Do you have any dietary restrictions? Use the calculator to optimize your order.\\n\\nETA: I am told that beans without rice is considered an incomplete protein.  I have not done the research to validate that claim.Comment 95: [deleted]Comment 96: You goodComment 97: Don\\'t feel bad for indulging occasionally or eating there right now when there are few other options. It\\'s just probably not the best idea to eat out basically anywhere on a long-term daily basis. Restaurants all love their salt, sugar and oils.\\n\\nMake it a once in a while treat and try to go for the healthier options and you\\'ll do great.Comment 98: Yes! Baby steps. It took me years to get where I am now. Do the best you can :)Comment 99: Okay, but also… be aware.. that it’s not very likely that a vegan will end up with high blood pressure, hypertension or stroke. The stress over worrying about it is probably more damaging than the actual intake of sodium. Life’s short, we all die. I say - eat the damn salt. (Unless your doctor tells you otherwise). :)Comment 100: You’re welcome. By the way, with all that food, is that wrapped in a tortilla? And, why extra?Comment 101: Yeah, this is my only qualm with the chipotle. If I recall correctly, the sofritas has even more salt than the chicken :(Comment 102: Good golly that is an astounding amount of sodium (I looked up my favorite).  Good thing that is so enormous its like 3 meals for me.  And having low blood pressure is a plus with this food, lol.Comment 103: Just start doing r/OMAD \\n\\nBoom. Problem solved.Comment 104: Salt isn\\'t harmful for you, read \"The Salt Fix\".Comment 105: Currently working there and it\\'s 3 tablespoons of salt for the guacComment 106: Don\\'t you think that this is an oversimplification? Do you think that someone maintaining a plant based diet with too much salt is at greater risk than someone that consumes high fat /highly processed diet?Comment 107: [deleted]Comment 108: \"Sodium isn\\'t unhealthy if you drink water, oil is ok if it\\'s vegetable oil.\" A lot of people here haven\\'t done their homework.Comment 109: Point D always annoys me too hahahaComment 110: Good points ! And I am plant based so my definition of healthy is more veggies and no meats or diary and minimal processed foodsComment 111: Do hot sauces really normally have high sodium?Comment 112: I will definitely try that sounds delicious!Comment 113: Thanks for the feedback !Comment 114: Thanks!Comment 115: And you say this based on what?Comment 116: I don’t get a tortilla just a bowl and I normally get extra because I am plant based and I only eat one time a day so I make sure I am getting enough food ! Especially beans since they are packed full of proteinComment 117: Says private community. What is OMAD?Comment 118: Do you have any insight or tips on how to replicate the sofritas? I know there’s copycat recipes online, but the ones I’ve tried are never as good as the original.Comment 119: Depends how much you run and sweat. If you\\'re running marathons you\\'re going to need more, no hard rule that I\\'m aware of. RDI is still <1500mg per day though. Most people already overdo it on the salt for the rest of the day. If you feel better with some sodium post run then go for it, just take the minimum you need to feel better and watch the rest of your days intake. \\n\\nYou\\'re way ahead of the curve just because you\\'re active. You can also try some potassium chloride or 50/50 sodium/potassium post run for that salt craving though. If you feel better after some potassium chloride, then your body probably wasn\\'t as sodium depleted post run as you thought, and it was more of a salty craving.Comment 120: I guess your critical-thinking skills running a bit dry today :)\\n\\nSalt isn\\'t inherently bad. If you have an excess of salt (whatever scale you wanna use, your choice at this point) over a period of time without proper hydration, then yes... it\\'s bad. But the salt itself is fine and a part of our human function *as long as you have proper hydration*. And I didn\\'t say anything about vegetable oil, that\\'s it own rabbit hole. Y\\'all wild.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nFam blocked me. Here\\'s my response friend. :)  \\n\\n\\n>9-11 truther level idiocy.\\n\\nOkay, you\\'ve piqued my interest. I\\'m genuinely curious how you can compare what I\\'m saying to that level of stupidity. Let\\'s go, educate me. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Who said you did? Are you drinking again?\\n\\nNo one said I did, I was pointing out that it wasn\\'t mentioned, so there\\'s no reason to even bring it up. Context clues my friend. :) Also, thanks for the concern, but I rarely drink. Appreciate ya!Comment 121: The road to riches is paved with homework.Comment 122: Great! Definitely use the calculator to determine what values you’re getting. You can eat vegan and still eat a lot of fat or other things you don’t want.  I’m a fan of the calculator to adjust my Chipotle orders when I visit.Comment 123: Which exactly are you asking about? The stress or the likely hood of a vegan ending up with those sorts of ailments? I’ll Google if for you if you’d like.Comment 124: It seems ok, but, the salt and the oil used in the cooking process is no bueno. Obviously you could do a lot worse.Comment 125: One meal a dayComment 126: They come prepackaged to throw on the grill like r/poopystinkfart mentioned.Comment 127: unfortunately the sofritas come pre bagged so theyre not made in houseComment 128: >But the salt itself is fine and a part of our human function as long as you have proper hydration.\\n\\n9-11 truther level idiocy.\\n\\n>And I didn\\'t say anything about vegetable oil\\n\\nWho said you did?  Are you drinking again?Comment 129: Yes absolutely! I will definitely be utilizing that calculator from now onComment 130: Vegans being immune to the blood-pressure raising effect of salt and stress being the more important contributor in them.\\n\\nI\\'d want to see that sourced in published scientific research because I don’t think it’s true and it’s a sweeping claim to make.Comment 131: I have a cookbook called The Two Meal Day by Max LoweryComment 132: \"Who said you did?  Are you drinking again?\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou didn\\'t, therefore it\\'s his critical thinking skills that are running dry lol.Comment 133: I’d also like to add personal experience: I’ve never met a vegan with hypertension. I do, however, know a vegan who was hospitalized due to lack of salt. He was convinced salt was unhealthy and completely omitted it from his diet. If you need evidence that someone could suffer consequences of not having enough salt in their diet, please let me know.\\n\\nI also would like to add that I, myself, suffer the consequences of stress. I’m working really hard on it. I believe food is an enormous source of stress for many people. Especially when the think they need to take it to the extreme.Comment 134: “Studies have shown that short-term stress boosted the immune system, but chronic stress has a significant effect on the immune system that ultimately manifest an illness. It raises catecholamine and suppressor T cells levels, which suppress the immune system.”\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341916/#abstract-1title\\n\\n“Nevertheless, the investigators found that vegans and lacto-ovo vegetarians had significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and significantly lower odds of hypertension (0.37 and 0.57, respectively), when compared to non-vegetarians.”\\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5466938/Comment 135: These are anecdotes. They are far down the evidence scale and may matter to you but are not generalisable. A salt-free diet is not the same as avoiding daily ingestion of high salt meals.Comment 136: Thanks but none of this proves that vegans don\\'t have their BP raised by salt intake. It just shows that they typically eat more vegetables and less salt which actually tends to support my point of daily high salt meals not being good for BP.\\n\\nStress *also* being a factor doesn\\'t mean salt isn\\'t also a relevant one.Comment 137: Sure anecdotal but also relevant (not to mention my offer for a link). The experience taught me, and perhaps will help someone lurking here (since there is fear mongering happening on this thread)- that completely restricting salt from one’s diet entirely is extreme and dangerous.\\n\\nAnd food being a common source of stress is pretty evident on this thread. People seem very concerned over something that is unlikely to effect them negatively. Like I said, agree to disagree bc I’m not responding to anymore of these.Comment 138: *facepalm* Ok you are really twisting things because I’m not making any wild claims here. These articles do in fact support my claim that vegans are less likely to suffer from high blood pressure and that stress can be detrimental to one’s health. And if you still don’t see my point then let’s agree to disagree!Comment 139: I can tell you that I have been vegan for 6 months and I had very high blood pressure prior. now my blood pressure is 105/55 consistently. my doctors are even shocked and even thoe I have been eating chipotle every day I still start my day off with a big bowl of over night steel cut oats loaded with all the fruits and seeds I can find ! I typically eat one cooked meal a dayComment 140: '"

       "\"The original question was about whether Chipotle is healthy.
